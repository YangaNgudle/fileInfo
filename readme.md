<h1>File Info Application<h1>
<hr/>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A simple application written in java that accepts a directory and returns information about that directory</p>

<h2>Set Up</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Navigate into the directory you cloned the repo to</li>
	<li>Run docker build -t entersekt .</li>
	<li>Run docker run ap -p 4000:80 entersekt</li>
</ul>

<p>
	This should set up the environment and allow you to access the application which you could use by simply entering a directory and have it spew back information about it.
